This system mainly focuses on basic operations in a Hospital like Appointment module, Inpatient and Outpatient module, Treatment module, Payment, billing module, Reports, and statistics module. This application is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive user interface, combined with strong searching insertion and reporting capabilities. The report generation facility of this application helps to get the complete overview of hospitals.

There have several challenges we have been faced:

1) Clearly defining our goals.
2) Choosing the right tech stack.
3) Group performance and speed.
4) Security threats of system and code. 
5) Knowledge of framework and platform.
